This is a overview of how the react components are structured in this front end project.

# Structure
Each page/section should have its own folder with the Atoms, Molecules and Organisms structure below. Each component in the Atoms, Molecules and Organisms folders should hve its own folder with the .tsx file and a .css file.

## Atoms:

Basic building blocks of matter, such as a button, input or a form label. Theyâ€™re not useful on their own, and is purely functional (same input always result in same output).

## Molecules:

Grouping atoms together, such as combining a button, input and form label to build functionality.

## Organisms:

Combining molecules together to form organisms that make up a distinct section of an interface (i.e. navigation bar)

## Templates:
Templates for pages.

## Pages:

A distinct ecosystem that consists of several distinct organisms.
