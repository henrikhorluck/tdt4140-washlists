This is a web-based system for organizing cleaning via a shared cleaning list. 
Designed and developed for _Studentsamskipnaden i Fredrikstad_ (SIF), a student housing organization in Fredrikstad.

Below is a guide on how to run the web application's backend and frontend. Be sure to check out the 
[wiki](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/tdt4140-2020/28/-/wikis/home) for more detailed documentation like a user manual 
and development routines.

## Basic architecture description

The cleaning organising system is a web application. It consists of a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) backend
using a SQLite database management system. The backend provides a REST-API, which the frontend uses for persistence, and 
other logic, like resetting washlists. The frontend uses [react](https://reactjs.org/), with
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

The frontend code is in the [`frontend`](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/tdt4140-2020/28/-/tree/dev/frontend) directory.
The backend code is in the [`backend`](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/tdt4140-2020/28/-/tree/dev/backend) directory.

## Running the backend

The following instructions are for a Linux based operating system, but should be similar for other operating systems.

### Prerequisites

Django is written in Python so you will need that, any 3.8.* version will work. You can download it from Python's 
[website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). We also recommend installing the project dependencies in a virtual
environment, like [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv), to avoid conflicts with existing 
installations. 

> Advanced users can use our supplied Dockerfiles, but they are intended for eventual production usage, and not for
local development, however you can find instructions for setup in `docker_setup.md`.

Once you have verified that you have a valid version of Python available (`python --version` prints 3.8.*). You need to 
install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org), which can be done through Python standard package installer pip, or any of
the methods listed on Poetry's website:

```bash
pip install poetry
```

Poetry is our choice of dependency management system for our backend, since it has an intuitive CLI, and supports lockfiles.

### Install dependencies

All commands from here and below assume you are in the `backend`-directory, which you can navigate to using:

```bash
cd backend
```


The dependencies for the backend are specified in `backend/pyproject.toml`. Here we specify which dependencies 
the project depends on, and which range of versions are valid. At any given time, the version is locked to a specific
version, which is listed in `backend/poetry.lock`.
   
To install the dependencies (Django, Django REST Framework, and more), run the following: 

```bash
poetry install
```

### Migrating the database

We are almost ready to run the backend. We first need to set up the database tables, by applying the migrations.
You can do that by running the following command:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Loading testdata and running the server

Before running the server, we highly suggest that you first load our testdata, which will add a set of test-users, with
roles, dormrooms, and student villages, and lets you connect from the frontend without any further setup. Credentials
for the supplied users lieare found in `backend/fixtures/testdata.yaml` as comments to the password-field on each user. Do note
only the users with `is_staff = true` can access the admin site, and it varies how much they have access to. For local 
backend development, the user `admin` with password `admin` is usually sufficient.

The test data can be loaded with the following commands:

```bash
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/testdata.yaml
```

See the [docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/initial-data/) for details about this process.

You can then start the server with the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The project should then be live at `http://localhost:8000`. The admin site can be found by going to `/admin`, there you
can add users, create dormooms, and student villages. You can browse the available API at `/api` after
first logging into the admin site. 

For a full list of available commands, see Django's [docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/django-admin/#available-commands).

## How to run the frontend

> We here assume that you have the backend running on `localhost:8000`, and have loaded the supplied fixtures.
If that is _not_ the case, you will have to set a list of environment-variables, which can all be found on the bottom of
this README. The environment-variables need to be set, so that the application knows which backend it should communicate
with, and where. That should **not** be necessary for local development.

As with the backend, all commands from here and below assume you are located in the `frontend`-directory, which you can 
navigate to using:

```bash
cd frontend
```

### Prerequisits
We assume that you have a version of `node` >= 12 installed, and that the Node package manager, `npm`, is in your PATH.
You can install Node from their [website](https://nodejs.org). 

> Advanced users _can_ use our Dockerfiles, but that is **not** recommended for local development, and much more
cubersome to set up. If you still want to set up Docker see `docker_setup.md`.

### Install dependencies
We first need to install our dependencies, consisting mostly of React and Next.js. You can install them by running:

```bash
npm install
``` 

### Start the front end
Once you have the dependencies installed, you can start the frontend in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The website should then be available from [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. If you make
any changes to the code, it will hot-reload.

#### Production
To run in production mode, you will instead need to first build the project, before starting the server in production
mode which is done using the following commands:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

This is normally not needed for local development, but can be useful if you are trying to test e.g. serverside rendering.

## Testing

To run the unittests in the backend run the following command in the `backend`-directory, after installing the 
dependencies:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

For code coverage, run the following when in `backend`:

```bash
coverage run manage.py test
coverage report
```

You can run the frontend tests with this command, when in the `frontend`-directory:

```bash
npm run test
```

This also prints code coverage.

## Available environment variables

Here is a list of variables you can use to configure the application. You **should not** need to change any of them
for the application to run locally. They are mostly necessary when deployment is set up.

### Frontend

Most of these variables are so that the frontend knows _which_ backend it should communicate to.

<dl>
    <dt><code>SIF_BACKEND_CLIENT_ID</code></dt>
        <dd>Related to OAuth authorization.You can get the values by  
        registering an application at <code>&lt;backend-domain&gt;/o/applications/register/</code> when the backed is
        running, the default domain for local development is <code>http://localhost:8000</code>. See #41 for an 
        explanation with images. See <code>django-oauth-toolkit</code>'s <a href="https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rest-framework/getting_started.html#step-3-register-an-application">docs</a> for details. 
        </dd>
    <dt><code>SIF_BACKEND_CLIENT_SECRET</code></dt>
        <dd>Also used for OAuth authorization. See above.</dd>
    <dt><code>SIF_BACKEND_DOMAIN</code></dt>
        <dd>
        The domain the backend is running on. Defaults to <a href="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000</a> unless overriden.
        </dd>
    <dt><code>SIF_DOMAIN</code></dt>
        <dd>
        The domain the frontend is running on. Defaults to <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> unless overriden.
        </dd>
</dl>

### Backend

You **should not** need to touch 
Used for [Django-settings](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/tdt4140-2020/28/-/blob/dev/backend/sif_vaskelister/settings.py).

<dl>
  <dt><code>DJANGO_SECRET_KEY</code></dt>
    <dd>See Django's <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/settings/#std:setting-SECRET_KEY">docs</a>.</dd>
  <dt><code>DJANGO_DEBUG_MODE</code></dt>
    <dd>Sets Django debug mode. Defaults to <code>true</code>, set it to any other value to deactivate debug-mode.</dd>
  <dt><code>DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS</code></dt>
    <dd>Says which host/domain names the backend can run from, see Django <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts">docs</a>. Defaults to "*", which means any.</dd>
  <dt><code>DJANGO_CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL</code></dt>
    <dd>Practically sets if CORS is enabled or disabled, helpful during development. See django-cors-headers <a href="https://github.com/adamchainz/django-cors-headers#configuration">docs</a>.
  For production setup, an environment variable for <code>CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST</code> should be set up.</dd>
  <dt><code>POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_CREATE</code></dt>
    <dd>We use <a href="https://python-poetry.org">Poetry</a> for dependency management, which autmatically sets up a virtualenv, but when we run the frontend in Docker, that is not necessary.</dd>
  <dt><code>PYTHONUNBUFFERED</code></dt>
    <dd>Ensures Python prints to stdout, see e.g. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29663459/python-app-does-not-print-anything-when-running-detached-in-docker">this</a> Stack Overflow question.</dd>
